# InfraHeal Technologies, Inc.

**Decision-Responsive Materials for Resilient Infrastructure**

InfraHeal Technologies is an early-stage advanced materials startup developing **stress-selective, self-healing composite materials** for U.S. infrastructure applications. Our technology enables structural materials to autonomously detect high-risk stress regions and activate healing **only where failure is most likely**, extending service life and reducing maintenance costs.

## 🌉 Problem

U.S. infrastructure systems—including bridges, public buildings, and transportation assets—fail primarily due to **localized stress concentrations** that initiate cracking long before visible damage occurs. Existing inspection and repair approaches are reactive, labor-intensive, and increasingly unsustainable under climate-driven loading and workforce constraints.

Current self-healing materials are limited because they:
- Heal uniformly rather than selectively  
- Activate passively without stress awareness  
- Inefficiently use healing capacity

## 💡 Innovation

InfraHeal Technologies is developing a **stress-selective self-healing composite platform** that integrates:

- **Shape Memory Polymer (SMP) matrices** for controlled crack closure  
- **Fiber-reinforced composites** that localize high-stress regions via strain or resistance response  
- **Localized thermal or magnetic activation** confined to critical regions  
- **Data-driven decision support** using Python-based analytics  

This approach embeds **decision-responsive behavior directly into materials**, representing a new class of intelligent infrastructure materials.

## 🧪 Phase I Objective (NSF SBIR)

The Phase I objective is to demonstrate **technical feasibility** of stress-selective self-healing at the coupon level under a $275K NSF SBIR Phase I scope.

Key goals:
1. Formulate SMP–fiber composite materials  
2. Demonstrate stress localization  
3. Trigger localized healing only at high-stress regions  
4. Quantify crack closure and mechanical recovery  
5. Log stress and healing events using simple analytics

## 🏗️ Applications

Initial target applications include:
- Bridge and transportation infrastructure retrofit wraps  
- Structural building components and high-risk joints  

The platform supports multiple future products from a single material architecture.
